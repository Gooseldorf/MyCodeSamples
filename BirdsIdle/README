The basic idea is that there are trees with branches. Several birds can perch on each branch, earning in-game currency. Decorations can also be on branches, providing bonuses.

I've added DragNDropController and ItemPositionController to show how they move birds and decorations.

World Controller:
 - Initializes game state, including user settings, In-App Purchase (IAP) services, and player data.
 - Controls game elements via UIManager and TreeController.
 - Handles pause events for saving player states and calculating offline income.
 - Performs game state updates.

TreeController:
 - Initializes and tracks 'Tree' state.
 - Manages branch-related game elements and their unlock states.
 - Responds to game events like planting a bird or decor, and player level up.
 - Handles user interactions with branches and updates tree structure visually.

BranchController:
 - Manages the branch element and its interactive containers.
 - Maintains the lock state of the branch and handles toggle events.
 - Initializes and updates the branch state.

BirdController:
 - Manages the bird object including its visual presentation and interactions.
 - Responds to user interactions and bird-related events.
 - Handles bird incubation process and state.
 - Manages bird lifespan events.

DecorController:
 - Manages the decor object and its visual aspects.

DragNDropController:
 - Handles drag and drop actions for birds and decors.
 - Controls position and movement of dragged items.
 - Incorporates mechanisms for controlling item dragging outside game borders.

ItemPositionController:
 - Manages different states of item positioning and interaction.
